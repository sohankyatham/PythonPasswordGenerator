# PythonPasswordGenerator

By: Sohan Kyatham

This is the code for the Python Password Generator. The Python Password Generator is a strong password generator created in Python Tkinter. The password generator takes a length of characters and then generates a strong password based on the length of characters that the user wants. The password generator creates a strong password with a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Then the user can use that password for anything they want.
